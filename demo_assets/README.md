# Trying out Baggage Advisor
To try out Baggage Advisor at home with your webcam, simply print out the [qr_codes](qr_codes.pdf) PDF and cut the QR code cards apart on the dashed lines.

You don't need to place the QR codes atop one another; you can simply show them to your camera one-at-a-time. Just watch the messages appear on the video feed.

## Procedure
1. Show the Cart Area.
2. Show a Cart. This represents putting a Cart onto the Cart Area.
3. Show a Baggage. This represents putting a Baggage onto the Cart or the Cart Area, depending on the previously seen code.
4. Try out different combinations of QR codes.

There are four Carts but only three Manifests. This is intended to show the effects of loading a Cart with no more available Manifests. There is also Baggage D, which does not appear in any manifest, to show the effects of having an incorrectly loaded Baggage.
